# Expass 4
Fun task, I had a bit of problems with the optional task, as it wouldn't run, but it was because I was missing the pom.xml file, and running in terminal, but I managed to figure it out.

## Questions
### Explain the used databases
The database used in the project is H2, which is a lightweight database running locally used for development and testing.
The database is initialized when the EntityManagerFactory is created.

### Can you provide with the SQL used to create the table ```CUSTOMER```
You can turn on SQL logging with hibernate to see the generated SQL.
```SQL
create table Customer (
    id bigint generated by default as identity,
    name varchar(255),
    primary key (id)
)
```

###
I could not figure out how to generate a schema

# Expass 3
For this task I decided to go for vue, as that is my prefered frontend library.

## frontend
The way it looks at the moment is very bare bones.

## Connecting it up to the backend
Worked fine, as I have both the functionality to create polls and vote working.

The user is still a tester user, and needs to be added later, and it is possible to vote many times with just user which isn't optimal :p

The way it is done is with **Axios** and **Pinia**. These were interesting libraries that I wanted to try out.
Functionally axios is the same as **fetch()** and Pinia is just a different way to do stores.

Setting it up was honestly more challenging than anticipated, and has taken most of the time.
